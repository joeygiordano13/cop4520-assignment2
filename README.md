Problem 1:

Problem 2: 
Choice 2) The Minotaur’s second strategy allowed the guests to place a sign on the door 
indicating when the showroom is available. The sign would read “AVAILABLE” or “BUSY.” Every guest 
is responsible to set the sign to “BUSY” when entering the showroom and back to “AVAILABLE” upon exit. 
That way guests would not bother trying to go to the showroom if it is not available.

A: Of the three choices this is my ideal strategy because it doesn't require that guests simply wait at
the door in a queue or have the thread become inactive/off/sleeping when it's waiting. Downsides include 
the fact that we may be performing unneccesary checks, and the frequency of guests being able to get in 
the room multiple times is greater, since they don't have to wait in a line.
